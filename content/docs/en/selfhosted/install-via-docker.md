# MoodHelper Chatbot Installation Guide

Welcome to the MoodHelper Installation Guide! This page will walk you through the steps to get your own instance of MoodHelper up and running using Docker, a powerful platform that can help you deploy applications with ease. Whether you're an IT professional or a tech enthusiast, these instructions are designed to get you started without any hassle.

## üê≥ Docker Installation Overview

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from each other and bundle their own software, libraries, and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. For MoodHelper, we'll be using a Docker container to encapsulate its environment and dependencies, making it easy to deploy across different systems.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Before diving into the installation, ensure you have Docker installed on your system. If not, visit the [official Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get it set up. Once Docker is ready, you can proceed with installing MoodHelper.

### üì¶ Installation Methods

You have two main methods to deploy MoodHelper using Docker:

1. **Deploy via Portainer** (Recommended for those who prefer a GUI approach)
2. **Docker Pull & Up** (For those comfortable with the command line)

## üåê Deploy MoodHelper Using Docker

Here's a step-by-step guide for both methods:

### 1. Deploy via Portainer

Portainer is a versatile container management tool that makes it easy to deploy and manage Docker containers through a user-friendly web interface.

- **Step 1:** Log in to your Portainer dashboard.
- **Step 2:** Navigate to the "Containers" section and click on "Add Container."
- **Step 3:** In the "Image" field, enter `type32/moodhelper-nuxt:latest`.
- **Step 4:** Scroll down to "Env" and add the environment variables listed above.
- **Step 5:** Map the port `3000` on the container to a desired port on your host.
- **Step 6:** Click "Deploy the container" to start your MoodHelper instance.

### 2. Docker Pull & Up

For those who prefer the command line, follow these steps:

- **Step 1:** Open your terminal.
- **Step 2:** Pull the MoodHelper image by running:
  ```
  docker pull type32/moodhelper-nuxt:latest
  ```
- **Step 3:** Start the container with the necessary environment variables and port mapping:
  ```
  docker run -d -p YOUR_EXTERNAL_PORT_HERE:3000 \
  -e NUXT_OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_API_MODEL=YOUR_ENDPOINT_MODEL_NAME_HERE \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_AI_ENDPOINT=YOUR_CUSTOM_ENDPOINT_HERE \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=YOUR_SITE'S_PUBLIC_URL \
  -e NUXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME=YOUR_SITE'S_PUBLIC_NAME \
  -e NUXT_API_RATE_LIMIT=50 \
  -e NUXT_API_WINDOW_DURATION=15 \
  --name moodhelper type32/moodhelper-nuxt:latest
  ```

Replace `YOUR_EXTERNAL_PORT_HERE` with your desired port mapping if necessary. Ensure the port you choose is open and available on your network.

## üéâ Congratulations!

You have successfully deployed MoodHelper! Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your custom mapped port) in your web browser to access your MoodHelper instance.

### üîß Troubleshooting

Should you encounter any issues during the installation process, here are a few tips:

- Ensure Docker is running on your system.
- Check that the ports you're using are not already in use.
- Verify that all environment variables are correctly set.
